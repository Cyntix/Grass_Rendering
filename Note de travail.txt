In this project, we would like the grass planes to follow the camera, such that it cannot be noticeable, that
they are planes. The rotation is only applied on the x and z axes. We do not want the y axis, because we think it would be too weird if the planes were all visible when we are looking the terrain from the top of the scene.
Here is how we proceeded:
1. We compute centerGrassToCamera: the vector starting from the center of the plane to the camera.
2. We compute projection_on_y: the centerGrassToCamera projected on the y axis (y coordinate at 0). We normalize it.
3. We compute grassRotationAngle: the angle between the z axis and projection_on_y by using the dot product. If the z coordinate of the camera is smaller than 0, then the grass should rotate in the opposite way, so grassRotationAngle becomes -grassRotationAngle.
4. We rotate the plane around the y axis.
5. We draw the plane.
6. We rotate the plane to its original position.
